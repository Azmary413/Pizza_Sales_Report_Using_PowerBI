In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales data. The goal was to provide actionable insights that can help a pizza chain optimize its sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.

**Key Features of the Dashboard:**
* A summary of total sales, broken down by day, week, and month.
* Dynamic visualizations that allow the user to filter sales data by specific periods, pizza types, and locations.
* Key metrics such as average order value, total orders, and revenue trends.
* Interactive filters to explore sales data by specific periods, pizza types, and locations.
* Analysis of the best-selling pizzas, including sales volumes and revenue contributions.
